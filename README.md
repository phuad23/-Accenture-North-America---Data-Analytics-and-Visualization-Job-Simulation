# -FORAGE-ACCENTURE-VIRTUAL-INTERNSHIP
Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage - December 2024


1. I Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client named Social Buzz as a Data Analyst at Accenture

2. I Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions

3. I Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders

## Introduction
Social Buzz is a fast growing technology that need to adapt quickly to scale. Also Social Buzz wants to go public and 
they needs the services of some expert to help identify their needs and profer solutuion to their problem.

## Objectives/Problems
1. Audit of Social Buzz by data pracice
2. Recommendiation of Initial Public offer to Social Buzz
3. Analysis of Social Buzz Top 5 Most Popular category of content

## Processes
Data Understanding

Data Cleaning

Data Modelling

Data Analysis

Uncover insight

## Data Understanding
7 different Datasets was given and each dataset contains different columns and values.

## Data Cleaning
After understanding the data, then will clean the data by checking duplicate values, checking missing values e.t.c

## Data Modelling
A data model shows the relationship between different datasets as well as any links that can be use to merge the table.
After checking the data model, we are going to identify the datasets that are useful for the analysis. Also, to know the datasets that are useful for the analysis,
we have to consider the question asked which is the Analysis of the Social Buzz Top 5 Most Popular category of content. we were able to identify these three (3) datasets that are useful
for the analysis; Reaction, Content and Reaction Types.

To create the final datasets for the analysis, we have to merge all the three dataset together and "Vlookup" formular was used to merge the 3 dataset into 1. 

View the cleaned and final dataset in Excel [Here](https://github.com/phuad23/-Accenture-North-America---Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Job-Simulation/blob/main/Reactions.xlsx)

## Data Analysis
To figure out the Top 5 performing categories;

we add up the total scores for each category. "SumIF" formular was used to achieve this.

## Uncover Insight
After the Analysis was done, we were able to identify the top 5 most popular category of content which are as follows;
1. Animal
2. Science
3. Healthy Eating
4. Technology
5. Food

The Top 5 most popular category of content can be shown in the visual [Here](https://github.com/phuad23/-Accenture-North-America---Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Job-Simulation/blob/main/PieChart%20of%20accenture.PNG)
