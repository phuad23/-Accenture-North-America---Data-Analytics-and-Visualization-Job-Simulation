Uncover insight

## Data Understanding
7 different Datasets was given and each dataset contains different columns and values.

## Data Cleaning
After understanding the data, then will clean the data by checking duplicate values, checking missing values e.t.c

## Data Modelling
A data model shows the relationship between different datasets as well as any links that can be use to merge the table.
After checking the data model, we are going to identify the datasets that are useful for the analysis. Also, to know the datasets that are useful for the analysis,
we have to consider the question asked which is the Analysis of the Social Buzz Top 5 Most Popular category of content. we were able to identify these three (3) datasets that are useful
for the analysis; Reaction, Content and Reaction Types.

To create the final datasets for the analysis, we have to merge all the three dataset together and "Vlookup" formular was used to merge the 3 dataset into 1.
